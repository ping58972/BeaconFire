Question Name
SQL Practice - University Scheduling
Question Description
A university maintains data on professors, departments, courses and schedules in four tables: DEPARTMENT, PROFESSOR, COURSE and SCHEDULE.



Write a query to print the names of professor with the names of the course they teach (or have taught) within their department.
